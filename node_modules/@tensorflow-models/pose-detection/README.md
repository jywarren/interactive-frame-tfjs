# Pose Detection

This package provides multiple state-of-the-art models for running real-time pose detection.

Currently, we provide 3 model options:

#### MoveNet
[Demo](https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/demos/pose-detection/index.html?model=movenet)

MoveNet is an ultra fast and accurate model that detects 17 keypoints of a body.
It can run at 50+ fps on modern laptop and phones.

#### BlazePose:
[Demo](https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/demos/pose-detection/index.html?model=blazepose)

MediaPipe BlazePose can detect 33 keypoints, in addition to the 17 COCO keypoints,
it provides additional keypoints for face, hands and feet.

#### PoseNet
[Demo](https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/demos/pose-detection/index.html?model=posenet)

PoseNet can detect multiple poses, each pose contains 17 keypoints.

## How to Run It
In general there are two steps:

You first create a detector by choosing one of the models from `SupportedModels`,
including `MoveNet`, `BlazePose` and `PoseNet`.

For example:

```javascript
const model = poseDetection.SupportedModels.MoveNet;
const detector = await poseDetection.createDetector(model);
```

Then you can use the detector to detect poses.

```
const poses = await detector.estimatePoses(image);
```

The returned poses list contains detected poses for each individual in the image.
For single-person models, there will only be one element in the list. Currently,
only PoseNet supports multi-pose estimation. If the model cannot detect any poses,
the list will be empty.

For each pose, it contains a confidence score of the pose and an array of keypoints.
PoseNet and MoveNet both return 17 keypoints. Mediapipe BlazePose returns 33 keypoints.
Each keypoint contains x, y, score and name.

Example output:
```
[
  {
    score: 0.8,
    keypoints: [
      {x: 230, y: 220, score: 0.9, name: "nose"},
      {x: 212, y: 190, score: 0.8, name: "left_eye"},
      ...
    ]
  }
]
```

x and y represent the actual keypoint position in the image. If you need normalized
keypoint positions, you can use the method
`poseDetection.calculator.keypointsToNormalizedKeypoints(keypoints, imageSize)` to
convert x and y to [0, 1] range.

The score ranges from 0 to 1. It represents the model's confidence of a keypoint.
Usually, keypoints with low confidence scores should not be used. Each application
may require a custom confidence threshold. For applications that require high precision,
we recommend a larger confidence value. Conversely, applications that require high recall
may choose to lower the threshold. The confidence values are not calibrated between models,
and therefore setting a proper confidence threshold may involve some experimentation.

The name provides a label for each keypoint, such as 'nose', 'left_eye', 'right_knee', etc.

Refer to each model's documentation for specific configurations for the model
and their performance.
